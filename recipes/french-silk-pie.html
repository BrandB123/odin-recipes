    <p><i>A classic that's typically served with a traditional pie crust, but can also be made with a chocolate crust for extra chocolatey flavor!</i></p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>2 oz chopped, unsweetened chocolate</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Butter</li>
        <li>2/3 cup Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Powdered Sugar</li>
        <li>1 9-inch Pie Crust, prebaked</li>
        <li>Whipped Cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, whisk together the sugar and eggs. Cook over low heat and continue whisking until the mixture reaches 160 degrees. Remove from heat and add the chocolate and vanilla and stir. Let cool for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a mixer, cream the butter until light and fluffy. Add the cooled chocolate mixture and beat on high until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat the cream on medium-high until it begins to thicken, 3-4 minutes. Add powdered sugar and beat on low speed, then gradually return to medium-high until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Pour into the pre-baked crust. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Garnish with whipped cream and shaved chocolate.</li>
    </ol>
